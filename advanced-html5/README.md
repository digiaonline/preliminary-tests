# Advanced HTML5

This is a preliminary test to determine the technical ability of developers applying for senior front-end positions at Nord Software.

Before starting, please read carefully through the instructions below. You are free to look up any information online and offline and spend as much time on the test as you deem necessary. Please direct any questions to Eric Nishio at eric.nishio@nordsoftware.com.

Your task is to create a small [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) application that meets the following requirements:

- Generate 100 users containing randomized values for the following properties: id (string), name (string), gender (male or female), and age (number)
- Render a table that displays the users on individual rows
- Create a form for adding new users to the table (remember to validate the form)
- Paginate the data so that each page contains 20 users
- Make each user editable by clicking on a table cell (inline editing)
- Add support for deleting rows by clicking on a remove icon (remember to confirm deletion)
- Make each column sortable upon clicking on a column header (remember to support both ascending and descending order)

We will provide a [design](design.pdf) and expect your application to follow it as accurately as possible.

You will receive extra points for

- A developer-friendly installation guide
- Using ES2015+ features and a transpiler (e.g. [Babel](http://babeljs.io))
- Using a CSS framework and a CSS pre-processor
- Persisting the data in the browser
- Using a state container such as [Redux](http://redux.js.org)
- Adding CSS transitions where appropriate

Upon completing the test, please deliver the code as a zip file named `advanced-html5.zip` and send it to eric.nishio@nordsoftware.com.

Good luck!
