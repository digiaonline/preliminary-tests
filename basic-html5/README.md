# Basic HTML5

This is a preliminary test to determine the technical ability of developers applying for front-end positions at Nord Software.

Before starting, please read carefully through the instructions below. You are free to look up any information online and offline and spend as much time on the test as you deem necessary. Please direct any questions to Eric Nishio (eric.nishio@nordsoftware.com).

Your task is to create a small application that meets the following requirements:

- The application must be a static HTML5 application (only HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and fonts)
- Render a table that displays users on individual rows
- Create a form for adding new users to the table
- A user should have the following properties: id (string), name (string), gender (male or female), and age (number)
- Each user row should contain a button for deleting the respective user

We will provide a [design](design.pdf) and expect your application to follow it as accurately as possible.

You will receive extra points for

- A developer-friendly installation guide
- Form field validation
- Pagination
- Editing existing users
- Being able to sort users by each column
- Using a CSS framework
- Using a CSS pre-processor

Upon completing the test, please deliver the code as a zip file named `basic-html5.zip` and send it to eric.nishio@nordsoftware.com.

Good luck!
